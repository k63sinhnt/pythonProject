At noon, a 23-year-old man, riding a white horse, wearing a shirt and a yellow hat with the logo of a technology company, passed through several streets in District 3. Some car drivers had to stop or pull over to the side to let the horse pass. Many curious people took photos and filmed with their phones, causing traffic jams. When the young man rode the horse to the Hai Ba Trung - Nguyen Dinh Chieu intersection, he was asked to stop by traffic police.

On February 15, a leader of the Traffic Police Department in Ho Chi Minh City said that the young man riding a horse in the city center was fined for two administrative violations: "Driving an animal into the road section of motor vehicles" and "Not having enough equipment to contain the waste of the animal or not cleaning up the waste of the animal on the street or sidewalk" under Decree 100/2019, with a total amount of VND 160,000.
